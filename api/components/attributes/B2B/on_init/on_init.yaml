If the max_liability_cap is set as 100, and the max_liability is empty, that means the maximum aggregate liability will be INR 100. If both, max_liability_cap and max_liability are provided, then the maximum aggregate liability will be the lower of the two amounts. To illustrate, if the max_liability is set to “2”, the total transaction value is INR 100, and the max_liability_cap is set to 100. That will mean the maximum aggregate liability will be INR 100 (the lower of INR 200 and INR 100). If neither max_liability_cap nor max_liability are provided, i.e. both are empty, that would mean the contract does not have any clause related to limitation of liability. Effectively that would mean the liability is uncapped. If max_liability_cap and max_liability are both set to 0 (zero), that would mean that both parties agree that neither of them will bear any liability.

So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days, the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as 1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]
